# IT-SEM 5

A repository with all you'd need for your IT Engg 5th sem at VESIT :)

### Friendly Advice

Sem 5 (2021-22 batch) was very overwhelming for us given the number of technologies we had to learn. It seemed like a good step from MU to include these in our syllabus, but it also meant that we had a lot on our table aside from what we already had. We learned about a lot of technologies like **React, Node, Git & GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, Nagios, Terraform, Puppet and a lot of AWS Services**.

We recommend that you invest time in learning about these technologies genuinely as you might end up using a lot of them in your careers moving forward.

All the best!
